This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null values as function arguments. The `foo` function in `bug.js` has a flaw in how it handles null values. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by providing a more robust method for managing null arguments.
